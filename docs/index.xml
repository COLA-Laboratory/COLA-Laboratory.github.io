      <description>EMOC stands for Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization in C++ which is a framework for single-objective and multi-objective optimization.
For more information about installation and usage, please refer to the document site.
Features # Rich algorithms and problems
EMOC implemented about 30 algorithms and more than 80 test problems which both include single-objective and multi-objective types.
Developed in C++ and Cross-platform
All the source code of EMOC are wrote in C++. So the running efficiency is guaranteed when comparing other implementation with python, java or matlab.</description>

      <description>IEEE CIS Task Force 12 # Task Force on Decomposition-based Techniques in Evolutionary Computation Objectives # As the name suggests, the basic idea of the decomposition-based technique is to transform the original complex problem into simplified subproblem(s) so as to facilitate the optimization. Decomposition-based techniques have been widely used for solving both single- and multi-objective optimization problems. More specifically, in single-objective optimization, especially for the large-scale scenarios, which consider a tremendous amount of decision variables, the decomposition-based technique contains three aspects: 1) analyzing and understanding the fitness landscape and modularity structure of the underlying problem; 2) decomposing the original complex problem into several loosely coupled or independent subproblems based on the learnt characteristics; 3) using a meta-heuristic to solve these subproblems in a sequential or concurrent manner.</description>

      <description>Turing Workshop on Human-Centric Artificial and Computational Intelligence and Applications # Synopsis # Human-Centered artificial/computational intelligence (HCAI/CI) is an emerging discipline intent on creating AI/CI systems that amplify and augment rather than displace human abilities. Instead, HCAI/CI seeks to preserve human control in a way that ensures AI meets our needs while also operating in a reliable, robust, and transparent manner, delivering equitable outcomes, and respecting privacy.
This workshop is designed to bring key data scientists and AI experts from both academia and industry to sharing up to date research and innovation developments themed on HCAI/CI, but also help identify the key challenges in stakeholders.</description>
