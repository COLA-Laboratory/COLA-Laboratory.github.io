Our 3D RNA inverse dsign paper accepted to 
  ICLR 2026. Instead of chasing the sequence recovery rate, Tianmeng proposed new reinforcement learning guided alignment strategy that significantly improve the performance of inverse designed sequences that can be folded into the target structure. Structure matters!  Jan 26

We have three paper accepted to 
  AAAI 2026 Main Track. In particular, Tianmeng&rsquo;s is selected as an Oral paper (top 5% of over 31,000 submissions). His paper provides a very interesting theoretical discussion of a ‘well-known’ criterion (reinforcing monotonicity constraints) in multi-agent reinforcement learning. He challenged this domain and discovered that non-monotonic value decomposition can be ‘surprisingly’ good for learning dynamics. Very very congratulations to Tianmeng, Shengbo and Fan!  Nov 8">

<p>Our paper on &ldquo;Multi-Fidelity Methods for Optimization: A Survey&rdquo; has been accepted to ACM Computing Surveys. Congratulations to Fan who has contributed significantly and supported me in this survey. Multi-fidelity method is a classic optimization paradigm, which has been widely studied and applied in engineering domain, particularly aerodynamics etc. However, my philosophy is everything can be made multi-fidelity while it is pretty much like a problem-solving paradigm. It is super interesting direction to exploit and hopefully we will have new talented students jumping into this field in near future.
