However, the bibtex sources can be messy in the wild. Here are some useful tips to prepare a beautiful and clean bibtex file.\n Instead of searching from Google, it might be more convenient to search the corresponding paper or author in DBLP. There is an option to choose the export record as the BibTeX. It will be more efficient to use some text editor like Vim to facilitate your editing. However, there is a steep learning curve to manage the Vim. Be careful to include unnecessary components in your bib. For example, it will take extra space if you include url and doi. Note that most publishers have a strict rule on the page length. If the corresponding paper is not published yet, i.e., just accepted or in press, there is usually NO pages, volume and number related information. Instead, we just need to amend a note component in the bibtex: note={accepted for publication}.  In the following paragraphs, we mainly focus on three types of publications to give you some tangible examples.\nJournal article\nLet us use the following example from one of my papers to explain the format.\n@article{LiZKLW14,\rauthor = {Ke Li and\rQingfu Zhang and\rSam Kwong and\rMiqing Li and\rRan Wang},\rtitle = {Stable Matching-Based Selection in Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization},\rjournal = {{IEEE} Trans. Evol. Comput.},\rvolume = {18},\rnumber = {6},\rpages = {909--923},\ryear = {2014},\rdoi = {10.1109/TEVC.2013.2293776},\rtimestamp = {Mon, 27 Nov 2017 16:55:26 +0100},\rbiburl = {http://dblp.org/rec/bib/journals/tec/LiZKLW14},\rbibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, http://dblp.org}\r} Most components can be directly obtained from the paper itself. We only explicitly explain the following components.\n bibtex entry ABC:  A: The last name of the first author, e.g., \u0026ldquo;A = Li\u0026rdquo; in this example. B: The first letter of each of the other authors, e.g., \u0026ldquo;B = ZKLW\u0026rdquo; in this example. C: Shortcut of the publication year, e.g., \u0026ldquo;C = 14\u0026rdquo; in this example.   title: Please capitalize each word in the paper title, except for some conjunction words or so. journal: Please try to use the abbreviation of the journal name as much as you can. You can easily Google this information. Alternatively, you can refer to the relevant publisher for detailed information. pages: Please use double hyphens to connect the page numbers. doi, timestamp, biburl and bibsource are not always necessary. But you can find more information from the DBLP of the corresponding author(s).  If the paper is not published yet, the bibtex will be simplified as follows.\n@article{LiNGY21,\rauthor = {Ke Li and\rHaifeng Nie and\rHuiru Gao and\rXin Yao},\rtitle = {Posterior Decision-Making Based on Decomposition-Driven Knee Point Identification},\rjournal = {{IEEE} Trans. Evol. Comput.},\ryear = {2021},\rnote = {accepted for publication}\r}  Conference article\nConference paper is slightly different from the journal article. It is usually published as a proceeding thus there is no issue or volume number. Instead, we usually need to formulate the name of the proceeding. Sometimes the editors are required to be listed, but I usually recommend to omit that part. Let us use the following example to explain this format.\n@inproceedings{WuKJLZ17,\rauthor = {Mengyuan Wu and\rSam Kwong and\rYuheng Jia and\rKe Li and\rQingfu Zhang},\rtitle = {Adaptive weights generation for decomposition-based multi-objective optimization using Gaussian process regression},\rbooktitle = {GECCO\u0026#39;17: Proc. of the 2017 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference},\rpages = {641--648},\rpublisher = {{ACM}},\ryear = {2017},\rtimestamp = {Fri, 27 Mar 2020 09:03:02 +0100},\rbiburl = {https://dblp.org/rec/conf/gecco/WuKJLZ17.bib},\rbibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org}\r} The other rules are almost the same as the journal article, except the following components.\n booktitle is formulated as: S'Y: Proc. of the xxxx Conference on  S: Abbreviation of the conference, e.g., \u0026ldquo;S = GECCO\u0026rdquo; in this example. Y: Shortcut of the conference year, e.g., \u0026ldquo;Y = 17\u0026rdquo; in this example. xxxx: conference year, e.g., \u0026ldquo;xxxx = 2017\u0026rdquo; in this example.     Book\nBook is a bit different from the journal and conference papers. Most components can be directly derived from the book itself. You can apply the previous formats here. Let us use the following example to explain this format.\n@book{Deb01,\rauthor = {Kalyanmoy Deb},\rtitle = {Multi-Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms},\rpublisher = {John Wiley \\\u0026amp; Sons, Inc.},\raddress = {New York, NY, USA},\ryear = {2001}\r}  Technical report\n@techreport{ABC,\rauthor = {xx and\rxx},\rtitle = {xx},\rinstitution = {xx},\ryear = {xxxx}\r}  ArXiv paper\n@article{Frazier18,\rauthor = {Peter I.

It contains icons for websites and organisations related to academia that are often missing from mainstream font packages. It can be used by itself, but its primary purpose is to be used as a supplementary package alongside a larger icon set. Go here to view the full icon set along with instructions for their use.\nRequesting new icons\r#\r\rNew icons can be requested by creating an issue here. Before submitting a request, please check that the following conditions are satisfied:\n  The organisation in question is already using a logo/icon of appropriate dimensions (roughly square). If that doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, then there\u0026rsquo;s really not much that can be done, and the request will have to be ignored until such time that a logo/icon can be provided.\n  An icon of appropriate resolution can be provided or linked to. Ideally, the provided file will be a vector file (e.g. SVG, EPS, AI) or a PDF with the vector file embedded. These files are all very easy to work with, and result in the most faithful reproductions of the icon. Altenatively, high resolution raster images (e.g. JPEG, PNG, GIF) can work, but only if the resolution is high enough that the underlying shapes can be reproduced. Icons made from raster images take much longer to prepare, and require hand drawing each component and figuring out the exact typeface used for any letters. This process can be rather tedious, and I will only do this if there is significant demand for the icon. Favicon files can be useful in conjunction with larger logos that have non-ideal aspect ratios—where they can indicate which part of the logo to strip down to—but they are pretty much useless by themselves. The only time I have made an icon from a favicon was for arXiv, and that was only because: (i) It was heavily requested, and (ii) I was able to get feedback on the new icon from Paul Ginsparg, who made the original icon. You can still submit the request, but it will likely be ignored until someone else comes along and provides the file we need.\n  The icon can be reduced to monochrome. This is one of the basic requirements of a versatile icon, but it is often overlooked when icons are made by people who are not professional designers. Academia is full of unprofessional designers, and it is sometimes the case that a logo relies entirely on the use of different colours. In certain cases we can be creative (see the dblp logo), but more often than not it will be impossible to create a monochrome version of the icon. Again, feel free to make the request, but it will probably be ignored if an alternate logo cannot be found.\n  License\r#\r\r The Academicons font is licensed under the SIL OFL 1.1:  \rhttp://scripts.sil.org/OFL   Academicons CSS, LESS, and SASS files are licensed under the MIT License:  \rhttp://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html   The Academicons documentation is licensed under the CC BY 3.0 License:  \rhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/    Author\r#\r\r GitHub: https://github.com/jpswalsh Web: http://jpswalsh.com  "}),e.add({id:4,href:"/docs/research/archive_reading/",title:"Archive Reading",section:"Docs",content:"Archive of Reading Group\r#\r\rAgenda (Year 2020)\r#\r\rDec\r  Surrogate Assisted Evolutionary Algorithms, Fan Li Dec 27\n[slides]\n  RoboGrammar: Graph Grammar for Terrain-Optimized Robot Design, ACM Trans.

Decomposition-based techniques have been widely used for solving both single- and multi-objective optimization problems. More specifically, in single-objective optimization, especially for the large-scale scenarios, which consider a tremendous amount of decision variables, the decomposition-based technique contains three aspects: 1) analyzing and understanding the fitness landscape and modularity structure of the underlying problem; 2) decomposing the original complex problem into several loosely coupled or independent subproblems based on the learnt characteristics; 3) using a meta-heuristic to solve these subproblems in a sequential or concurrent manner. As for multi-objective optimization, the decomposition means to decompose the original multi-objective optimization problem into a number of single-objective optimization sub-problems (or simple multi-objective optimization problems) and then uses a meta-heuristic to optimize these sub-problems simultaneously and collaboratively. In this big data era, the decomposition-based techniques used for both single- and multi-objective optimization can be sythesized to address the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality, i.e., many objectives and large scale variables.\nThe key objective of this task force it to generalize the decomposition-based idea and to promote its related research, including its development, education and understanding of its sub topic areas.\nThe main objectives of the task force can be summarized as follows:\n create an active and healthy community to promote theme areas of decomposition-based techniques make student, researchers, end-users, developers, and consultants aware of the state-of-the-art promote the use of decomposition-based methodologies/techniques and tools organize conferences/workshop with IEEE CIS Technical Co-Sponsorship organize tutorials, workshops and special sessions launch edited volumes, books, and special issues in journals  Anticipated Interests\r#\r\rThis task force will focus on all aspects, including theory, practice and applications, of the decomposition-based technique in evolutionary computation for solving both single-, multi- and many-objective optimization problems.

semester to discuss papers. Participation is open to all, guests are always welcome; if you are interested in receiving invitations contact the organizer.\r\r\rMore about our reading group culture\r\u0026#43;\r\rEach week we will discuss a different paper. The paper to discuss is announced about one week in advance by the organizer. All participants are expected to read the paper before the meeting. It is recommended to take notes about insights, questions, and other points potentially worth discussing.\nThe goals of the reading group are:\n Critical reflection on scientific work Practice of reading and argumentation strategies Exposure to a broad range of research topics Practice of leading group discussions  The discussion is limited to one hour. The discussion is lead by a moderator, who may also set a focus for the discussion. The moderator will kick off the meeting by giving a short summary of the paper and raising a few points for discussion. The moderator should try to incorporate all participants into the discussion. The moderator role rotates through all participants. The moderator is encouraged to help with the selection of a paper that week.\n\r\r\rAgenda (Year 2021)\r#\r\rJune\r  Learning from Multiple Cities: A Meta-Learning Approach for Spatial-Temporal Prediction\nWWW 2019\n paper |  slides |  Jiangjiao Xu |  June 20\n  Bayesian temporal factorization for multidimensional time series prediction\nIEEE PAMI 2021\n paper |  slides |  Jiangjiao Xu |  June 13\n  Discrete Fourier Transform and Random Fourier Features\nData-Driven Science and Engineering, Chapter 2: 47\u0026ndash;83, 2019\n slides |  Phoenix Williams |  June 9\n  May\r  Global Optimization via Inverse Distance Weighting and Radial Basis Functions\nComput.
